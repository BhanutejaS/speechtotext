Real-time Speech-to-Text with Hugging Face Models

This project implements a real-time speech recognition pipeline using Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers and sounddevice.
It records microphone audio in chunks, streams them to a selected model, and logs predictions along with performance metrics (latency, real-time factor, etc.).
